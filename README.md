Game made for ludum dare 47.



Theme : Stuck in a loop.



You need to guide one of your cube companion to the exit. 

When You control one cube, its moves are recorded.

When you switch to another cube, time rewinds and the move previously recorded are replayed while you move the next cube.

Coordinate the movement of each cube to unlock the exit !!!



(Essentially, once you moved a cube, it is stuck in a loop, repeating the same move over and over again until one can reach the exit.)
